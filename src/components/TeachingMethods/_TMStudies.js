        EasyA was founded on the belief that students learn better when they are
        given the help they need, when they need it.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started out as a simple hypothesis by two former tutors (now our
        co-founders), based on their own teaching experience, has proven to be
        true.
      </p>
      <p>
        We took two groups of students from leading schools across the U.K. and
        looked at their academic performance over the course of a year. One
        group was beginning of the experiment the year, the students who had
        EasyA were scoring 82% on average vs 78% and by the end of the year,
        students on EasyA had an average score of 95% compared to 82% by the end
        of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        More importantly, these results are being felt by the hundreds of
        students who are getting better 11+ and GCSE grades as the result of
        EasyA resulted in both groups scoring 75% and 74%. However, half way
        through.
